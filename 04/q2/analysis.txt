we see that as the number of 'optimistic threads' increases from 0 to 3, the speed of the
program increases. In fact, 3 optimistic threads double the program speed in comparison to 0.

However, there is notably no speedup when there is only 1 optimistic thread. This may be because
the master thread finishes its DFA so fast that the program is essentially sequential -- no
thread switchihng occurs.

I am on a 4 core machine.
